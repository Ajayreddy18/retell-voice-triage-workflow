# Retell Voice Triage Workflow

A production-style **voice AI support triage pipeline** that converts call transcripts into structured CRM actions using **Retell, n8n, FastAPI, and Google Sheets**.

This project demonstrates how to build an **event-driven AI workflow** for startups that need fast customer support routing, lead qualification, and escalation logic.

---

## 🚀 What it does

When a voice transcript is received from a Retell AI call agent:

1. **Retell sends transcript data** to an n8n webhook
2. **n8n triggers the workflow**
3. **FastAPI backend classifies the call**

   * intent detection
   * urgency detection
   * transcript summarization
4. **Results are stored in Google Sheets CRM**
5. The workflow returns a **clean JSON response** for downstream automation

---

##  Example Use Cases

* Voice support ticket triage
* Urgent escalation detection
* AI receptionist workflows
* Sales lead qualification
* Post-call CRM enrichment
* Customer success routing
